Quick Take: Is Cash App Really Giving Away Money?
The truth is, the $750 Cash App reward through Flash Rewards’ partner site Rewards Giant USA is not a scam. It’s a legitimate program to earn extra money in your spare time. However, earning cash through Flash Rewards is not as easy as you might think it is. Here are some key takeaways

The Flash Rewards Web app allows you to earn rewards by completing certain activities called deals. It’s owned by Deliver Technology LLC, which also own Rewards Giant USA. 
The smartphone app also offers gift cards in exchange for coins you earn, but instead of completing surveys, you play games on your phone. The app earned 4.5 stars in the Google Play store.
The $750 Flash Rewards is legitimate, but it may not be easy, and you will need to spend some money to reach that level of earning.
Cash App is not giving away $750, but Flash Rewards gives people a chance to earn up to $750 in gift card rewards or Cash App or PayPal deposits by completing tasks online. These tasks include watching videos, taking surveys and also making specific purchases.
If you want to earn money through Cash App, consider referring friends using your Cash App referral code. You will both receive bonus cash after your friend links a debit card and sends $5 to someone within two weeks.
